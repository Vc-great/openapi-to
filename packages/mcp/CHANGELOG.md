## 4.0.0-rc.3

### Patch Changes

- @openapi-to/core@4.0.0-rc.3

## 4.0.0-rc.2

### Minor Changes

- 7c87d42: Add exact non-empty `replace` semantics to persistent operation selection while preserving the original add-only Core mutation, merge-result, and runtime return-shape contracts. The new generic mutation API lets Selective Prepare replace every legal persisted selection of up to 5,000 operations in one request while retaining per-key, manifest-byte, plan-memory, and bounded-summary limits. Approved Apply commits the complete frozen desired artifacts, ownership-constrained managed deletions, ownership manifest, and selection together while preserving unmanaged files, rollback, and recovery behavior.

## 4.0.0-rc.1

### Major Changes

- ed854a9: Move automatic configuration discovery to root `openapi.config.ts`, `.js`,
  `.cjs`, or `.mjs` files and move tool-managed state and managed output to
  `.openapi-to`.

  The former `.OpenAPI` configuration location is no longer discovered, and Core
  replaces the removed `folderName` export with `stateDirectoryName`. No
  compatibility fallback or automatic migration is provided; move the
  configuration and any state that must be retained manually.

### Minor Changes

- 4f10867: Add optional invocation-scoped cancellation to compiler, config, plugin, artifact, and comparison APIs, and harden the read-only stdio MCP server with bounded per-tool deadlines, cancellation-safe generation queuing, stable progress, structured stderr logging, fixed evaluation corpora, performance/stress gates, and operational security documentation. Existing Core and CLI calls remain source-compatible because every new execution option is optional. The repository fixed-version group coordinates the eventual public-package minor release; no versioning or publication is performed here.
- 3e1078b: Enable operator-gated controlled Selective Apply through the existing Prepare/Apply Tools. Selective plans now issue kind- and owner-bound one-time tokens, recompile and revalidate the frozen operation projection at Apply time, and atomically commit generated artifacts, ownership, and persistent selection through Core's generation-state transaction. Full generation and controlled full Apply semantics are unchanged.
- ce3f9f2: Add a deterministic Operation Catalog with bounded lexical search and single-operation contract summaries, plus trusted-target MCP discovery, search, and contract Tools with process-local compilation caching.
- 862f0ae: Add shared microservice Target selection and generator-managed Workspace output
  roots. The CLI now accepts repeatable `generate --target` options while Core,
  CLI, MCP, and packed-package smoke workflows share deterministic Target naming,
  output resolution, overlap protection, and write preflight.

  Preserve and verify JSON, YAML, YML, and HTTP(S) OpenAPI inputs across
  multi-target CLI and MCP workflows. Default output remains
  `.OpenAPI/<output.dir>`; opting into `output.base: "workspace"` keeps ownership
  inside the selected project output root while Operation selection remains in
  `.OpenAPI/selections`.

- b4130f7: Add a versioned deterministic operation Selection model and additive Selective Prepare. Prepare unions persisted and requested operations, binds selection/projection/artifacts into a review-only plan, and writes nothing. Selected plans cannot Apply in this phase, while full Prepare/Apply and existing write authority remain unchanged.
- f0a38b1: Add operator-gated, two-phase MCP generation writes through a short-lived HMAC-bound Prepare plan and an exact one-time Apply. Apply re-generates and rejects stale config, source, reference, output, manifest, or file state before committing only managed artifacts.

  Core gains public source/config fingerprints plus a shared cross-process output lock and transaction writer with same-filesystem staging, a stable ownership manifest, rollback, crash journal recovery, commit cancellation/deadline semantics, and fail-closed TOCTOU checks. The CLI keeps its command and output contract while using the same transaction/lock path, so its direct SemVer impact is patch; the fixed-version group will coordinate the eventual release version. No version or publication command is run by this change.

- 6aac98f: Harden remote loading by clearing trusted request headers on cross-Origin
  redirects and rejecting HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrades. Merge trusted Target remote
  requirements with MCP operator ceilings instead of replacing them; the MCP
  server API can now supply optional remote timeout, response-size, and redirect
  upper bounds while Tool schemas remain unchanged.

  Classify native Windows absolute inputs without treating drive letters as URL
  schemes, reject drive-relative and UNC configured inputs, and require portable
  output segments across Linux, macOS, and Windows. Extend cross-platform CI,
  stable lint coverage, package-surface checks, and real tarball consumers for the
  three aggregate binaries and shared MCP CLI subpath.

- b4130f7: Add deterministic projected OpenAPI compilations with exact operation selection, transitive named-component closure, and selective `openapi_generate_dry_run` previews. Omitted scope keeps full generation unchanged, and selective previews remain nonpersistent and add no write authority.
- ca8f1cb: Add the independent read-only stdio MCP server with bounded validate, inspect,
  diff, generation dry-run, and generation check Tools. Core gains opt-in local
  file-root confinement for entry and transitive reference reads plus the shared
  trusted configuration loader; the CLI now reuses that loader without changing
  its command contract.
- acfb118: Make `openapi-to` the complete user installation entrypoint. The aggregate now
  depends on the MCP runtime and installs the `openapi-to-mcp` command alongside
  the `openapi` and `openapi-to` CLI aliases, so most users no longer need to
  install `@openapi-to/mcp` separately.

  Expose the shared MCP CLI runner through the stable `@openapi-to/mcp/cli`
  subpath so both package bins use one argument parser and stdio Server startup
  implementation.

### Patch Changes

- 642c834: Align published package metadata, documented capabilities, CLI aliases, MCP Host setup, and release verification with the shipped package surfaces.
- f3d4d04: Use the native realpath representation for the trusted MCP Workspace so Windows
  temporary paths remain Workspace-relative across config loading, generation
  results, and cross-platform stdio smoke tests.
- 235162c: Add a bounded controlled sidecar-state abstraction to the shared Core transaction writer, with checksummed journal v2 state operations, physical preconditions, same-parent staging and backup, three-state rollback, and lock-triggered crash recovery. Existing no-state full writes retain journal v1 and the existing full Prepare/Apply contract.

  Selective plan binding now includes the previous selection physical snapshot and exact desired serialized-byte hash and length. Selective Prepare remains review-only with no returned token, selective Apply remains disabled before locks and writes, and no new MCP write authority or Tool is added.
