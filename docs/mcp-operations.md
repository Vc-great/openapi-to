# MCP operations guide

The MCP server requires Node.js 20 or newer and uses stdio only. Install the aggregate with `pnpm add -D openapi-to`, then launch `pnpm exec openapi-to-mcp --workspace-root .`. Without config it registers validate, inspect, and first-stage diff. Adding operator-trusted `--config .OpenAPI/openapi.config.ts` also registers target listing, operation search, bounded operation contract reading, generation dry-run, and check. Adding `--allow-write` registers Prepare and Apply only after all configured output roots pass Workspace validation. The complete matrices are 3 tools without config, 8 with trusted config, and 10 with controlled write.

The Workspace is canonicalized once. Local entries, transitive `$ref`, config imports, output roots, ownership manifests, and checked generated files must remain inside it. Remote loading denies private/reserved networks by default; only the operator may add `--allow-host` or the security-lowering `--allow-private-network`. Target remote config is intersected with those startup bounds rather than replaced: private access requires both layers, host policies must overlap, numeric limits use the smaller value, and only the trusted Target may define request headers. Cross-Origin redirects clear those headers and HTTPS-to-HTTP redirects fail.

Server deadlines are configured in milliseconds with `--validate-timeout-ms`, `--inspect-timeout-ms`, `--diff-timeout-ms`, and `--generation-timeout-ms`. Values must be integers from 100 to 600000. Client cancellation and Server timeout are distinct (`MCP_REQUEST_CANCELLED` versus `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`); remote HTTP timeout is a third limit. Cancellation propagates through compiler, plugins, artifacts, comparison, and queue waits.

Results are deterministic and bounded by diagnostics, operations/changes, artifacts, text, and preview limits. Totals remain accurate when arrays are truncated. Dry-run/Prepare default to no preview; binary bodies are never returned. Check reports `outdated` as an expected business result with `isError: true`, not a protocol failure. Dry-run/check never invoke the writer.

After operation search and contract review, `openapi_generate_dry_run` can take one trusted target plus `scope: { type: 'operations', operationKeys: [...] }`. Exact keys are deduplicated and sorted; the cached target compilation is projected to those operations and the complete required named-component closure before the existing plugins run. Missing or duplicated `operationId` values remain searchable but are rejected for selective generation. The response exposes only bounded projection statistics, a deterministic projection hash, artifact summaries, and optional bounded previews. Omitted or full scope retains the original full-target dry-run. See [projected compilation](./architecture/projected-compilation.md).

For persistent intent, write-enabled mode extends the existing `openapi_prepare_generation` input with `selection: { type: 'add', operationKeys: [...] }`. Selection means the project's complete desired operation set: previous keys are unioned with additions, and the complete desired set—not only the new keys—is projected and generated. The versioned manifest path is derived from trusted config/target/output identity and cannot be supplied by the caller. Bootstrap or OpenAPI identity drift fails closed. Selection snapshots/bytes, projection, complete ordered artifacts, desired ownership bytes, and existing source/config/output bindings enter the plan. Prepare returns `kind=selective`, `applySupported=true`, a one-time token, bounded summaries, and no filesystem change. After explicit approval, Apply recompiles the trusted target, regenerates exactly the frozen desired set, revalidates every binding, and atomically commits generated output, ownership, and selection. Full Prepare/Apply is unchanged. See [persistent operation selection](./architecture/persistent-operation-selection.md).

For large specifications, call `openapi_list_targets` when target discovery is needed, then `openapi_search_operations`, then `openapi_get_operation`. These Tools accept only startup-trusted target names, not a caller-supplied source/config/path. Successful target compilations and catalogs live for the Server process; concurrent first calls share one compilation, failed compilation can retry, and restart is the refresh mechanism. Search defaults to eight candidates and contract reading applies Schema depth/count/property/example and byte limits. See [Operation Catalog architecture](./architecture/operation-catalog.md).

For a multi-service project, the recommended sequence is `openapi_list_targets` → target-scoped search → target-scoped contract lookup → dry-run or Prepare → review → Apply. Target identity is independent from OpenAPI `info.title`; identical `operationId` or Schema names in different Targets do not share catalog, cache, selection, plan, or ownership identity. Operation-scoped dry-run and selective Prepare/Apply continue to accept exactly one Target. There is no cross-Target search or selective write plan.

## Controlled-write runbook

Start with `--workspace-root`, trusted `--config`, and `--allow-write`. Optional startup-only controls are:

```text
--plan-ttl-ms 300000
--max-plans 20
--max-plan-bytes 4194304
--max-total-plan-bytes 33554432
--max-write-files 5000
--max-write-bytes 268435456
--write-lock-wait-ms 30000
--commit-timeout-ms 60000
```

Call Prepare for exactly one configured target. Review added/modified/deleted counts, every returned path, truncation, and the exact `planHash`; a truncated external list does not truncate the stored plan. Prepare must leave the output tree byte-identical. Only after explicit user approval should the Host pass the returned `planId`, token, and approved hash to Apply.

Apply re-generates and fails stale rather than adopting new content. Selective Apply uses the plan's frozen complete desired operation set, not a fresh union from disk, and validates selection once before and once under the output lock. It may delete only unchanged regular files listed in the current ownership manifest and prepared deletion set. User/unmanaged files survive. Success consumes the token and updates files plus the version-2 ownership manifest; selective success also installs the selection in the same journal-v2 transaction. Failure after commit begins rolls back all participating states or reports a recovery-required high-severity diagnostic. There is no force or retry-with-new-plan behavior.

Cancellation while queued, regenerating, or staging stops cleanly. Cancellation after commit starts is deferred until commit/rollback finishes. The commit deadline is separate from the MCP generation timeout. `openapi_check_generation` should report current after success.

CLI generate and MCP Apply use the same cross-process output lock. Check/dry-run do not take the exclusive lock; if a writer is active they fail safely instead of claiming a stable current result. See [recovery](./mcp-write-recovery.md) before handling any leftover transaction state.

Configured output may use the default managed base below `.OpenAPI` or `base: 'workspace'` below the project root. The shared Core preflight rejects unsafe or overlapping output roots before generation. Ownership follows the resolved output root; persistent Operation selection remains in `.OpenAPI/selections`. Prepare does not create either location.

Use `--log-format json --log-level warn` for newline-delimited operational stderr logs. stdout is exclusively MCP JSON-RPC. Repository development uses `pnpm test:mcp:all` for the complete bounded gate, `pnpm mcp:check` for a synthetic built-bin health report, and `pnpm mcp:inspect` for foreground authenticated manual review. The package also keeps separate benchmark, stress, and Tool-selection evaluators; repository-only test/Doctor/Inspector scripts are not packed. See the [MCP test strategy](./testing/mcp-testing.md) for the automated/manual boundary.

The versioned baseline corpus has 1-operation small dialect fixtures, a 150-operation/81-schema medium document, a 700-operation/301-schema multi-file large document, a bounded 600-operation pathological document, and a 250-artifact generation fixture. The benchmark creates an isolated temporary 250-file Workspace for repeated full Prepare/Apply timing. Stress seeds 100 operations from the 700/301 fixture, adds one operation through 100 repeated Selective Prepare calls, requires a stable 101-operation projection and bounded output/RSS, then performs one real selective Apply and reports discovery/compile wall time, Apply wall time, transaction staging/commit times, staged/backup/journal bytes, and final file counts. Thresholds intentionally allow broad platform variance and never write benchmark output into the repository.
