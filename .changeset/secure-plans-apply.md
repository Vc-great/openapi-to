Add operator-gated, two-phase MCP generation writes through a short-lived HMAC-bound Prepare plan and an exact one-time Apply. Apply re-generates and rejects stale config, source, reference, output, manifest, or file state before committing only managed artifacts.

Core gains public source/config fingerprints plus a shared cross-process output lock and transaction writer with same-filesystem staging, a stable ownership manifest, rollback, crash journal recovery, commit cancellation/deadline semantics, and fail-closed TOCTOU checks. The CLI keeps its command and output contract while using the same transaction/lock path, so its direct SemVer impact is patch; the fixed-version group will coordinate the eventual release version. No version or publication command is run by this change.
