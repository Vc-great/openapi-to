Enable operator-gated controlled Selective Apply through the existing Prepare/Apply Tools. Selective plans now issue kind- and owner-bound one-time tokens, recompile and revalidate the frozen operation projection at Apply time, and atomically commit generated artifacts, ownership, and persistent selection through Core's generation-state transaction. Full generation and controlled full Apply semantics are unchanged.
